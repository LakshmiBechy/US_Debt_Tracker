# US Government Debt Analysis
## Project Overview
   This project provides an analysis of the United States' debt, focusing on the following components:
   - Debt Held by the Public
   - Intragovernmental Holdings
   - Total Public Debt Outstanding
The analysis explores year-over-year (YoY) debt growth, identifies historical monthly debt trends, and projects the growth of publicly held debt in the coming years.
## Objective
   This analysis aims to answer key questions about the US Government's debt:

   Yearly Debt Percentage Increase: What was the yearly percentage increase in debt compared to the previous year?
   Monthly Debt Variation: Which months historically show the highest and lowest increases in total debt?
   Projected Debt Growth: What is the expected growth of publicly held debt in the next few years?
   
## Data
   The dataset includes three key components of the US Government's debt:

| **Debt Held by the Public**     | Debt held by individuals, corporations, foreign governments, and other entities outside the US government. |
| **Intragovernmental Holdings**  | Debt held by US government agencies, also known as intragovernmental holdings.                        |
| **Total Public Debt Outstanding** | The sum of Debt Held by the Public and Intragovernmental Holdings.                                  |

## Analysis
   The analysis covers the following:

   - Yearly Debt Percentage Increase: Calculates the year-over-year percentage growth in Debt Held by the Public, Intragovernmental Holdings, and Total Public Debt Outstanding.
   - Monthly Debt Variation: Identifies which months have historically seen the highest and lowest debt increases.
   - Projected Debt Growth: Provides a forecast of the growth in publicly held debt over the next few years.

## Tools
Microsoft Excel: Used for data analysis, visualization, and projections.

## Findings and Insights

### Yearly Debt Percentage Increase:
    From 2016 to 2019, the Total Public Debt Outstanding saw an average yearly increase of about 5%.
    In 2020, there was a significant spike in debt, likely driven by the US government's pandemic response efforts.

    


    
### Monthly Debt Trends:
    Highest Debt Increase Months: January, February, November, and December have historically seen the largest increases in debt.
    Lowest Debt Increase Months: April, May, June, and July typically experience the lowest debt increases.
    Hypothesis: Debt tends to rise during the holiday seasons (Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Year's), when consumer spending increases. 
    Lower debt months are generally free of major holidays, leading to reduced borrowing.

   
### Projected Growth of Publicly Held Debt (2023–2027):
    - 1997–2007: Publicly held debt increased by about 1 trillion USD.
    - 2008–2019: Debt grew from 6 trillion USD to 17 trillion USD.
    - 2020–2022: Publicly held debt rose from 21.5 trillion USD to 25 trillion USD.
    - 2023–2027: Publicly held debt is projected to increase to 33 trillion USD.

    

    
The analysis concludes that publicly held debt will continue to grow steadily over the next five years.
